1.16.5 Book ban (XII) automated

Use ,d to generate the book. Copy it 23 times and put it into a shulker box.
When you break the shulker box everyone with the chunk in render distance will be kicked when trying to join.
The glitch wasn't found by me, i just made the mod to automate it by editing the book dupe one.
